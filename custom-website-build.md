- **Novus Labs** - 17+ years of engineering services for top-tier consumer electronics brands (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Oculus, etc.)

We've been rolling AI-enabled tools across more than a dozen organizations in the region already, then productizing those lessons for local businesses through AI Ready PDX.
