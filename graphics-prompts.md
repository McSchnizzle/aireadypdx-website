## 1. PRIMARY LOGO (Icon + Wordmark)

### Prompt:
```
Create a flat vector logo for a company called "AI Ready PDX". The concept is a simple evergreen tree made from connected dots and lines, symbolizing both the Pacific Northwest and AI networks. Style: minimal, modern, professional, and reassuring (reflecting a 30-year tech legacy), not playful or experimental. Use a limited palette of deep forest green (#0B3D2E), slate blue (#1F3A5F), and a touch of teal (#2BBBAD) on a light background. Include a clean sans-serif wordmark "AI Ready PDX" to the right of the icon. No gradients, no 3D, suitable for web and print.
```

### Alternative Concept:
```
Design a professional, modern logo for "AI Ready PDX" - a Portland, Oregon-based AI consulting company. The logo should combine the letters "AI" in a creative monogram with a subtle Pacific Northwest element such as an evergreen tree silhouette, the St. Johns Bridge arch, or Mt. Hood outline. Use deep forest green (#0B3D2E) as the primary color with a teal (#2BBBAD) accent. The style should feel established and trustworthy, not startup-y or overly techy. Clean lines, balanced composition, works well at small sizes. No gradients. Transparent background.
```

---

## 2. WORDMARK ONLY (Text Logo)

### Prompt:
```
Design a clean wordmark logo that says "AI Ready PDX". Style: modern sans-serif with slightly rounded corners, professional but inviting. The logo should feel established, as if the company has been in tech leadership for decades. Emphasize "AI" subtly, perhaps with a different weight or color. Use deep forest green (#0B3D2E) and dark grey (#1E2022) on a white or light neutral background. No icon, just typography.
```

---

## 3. FAVICON / APP ICON

### Prompt:
```
Design a simple square icon/favicon for "AI Ready PDX" that works at 32x32 pixels. Feature a minimalist "AI" lettermark with a single subtle evergreen tree or mountain peak element. Deep forest green (#0B3D2E) on transparent background. Must be instantly recognizable at small sizes.
```

---

## 4. WEBSITE HERO IMAGE

### Prompt:
```
Create an illustration for a website hero section. Scene: a Portland-style small business environment (for example, a coffee shop storefront and a landscaping truck) with subtle hints of AI, like soft connection lines or gently glowing nodes around tools and devices. Style: flat, minimal, slightly geometric, with a Pacific Northwest color palette of greens (#0B3D2E), blues (#1F3A5F), teals (#2BBBAD), and warm neutrals (#F4F1EA). The overall feeling should be calm competence: "we've done this before," not "shiny startup." No text in the image. 16:9 wide aspect ratio for use as a web banner.
```

### Alternative Hero Concept:
```
Create a hero section background image for an AI consulting website. Scene: Abstract representation of Portland, Oregon - silhouettes of evergreen trees and distant mountain (Mt. Hood) with subtle digital network patterns woven through. Style: modern, professional, warm lighting like golden hour. Color palette: deep forest greens, slate blues, and warm amber accents. No people, no text. The image should feel technological but grounded and natural. 1920x1080 resolution, subtle enough to have text overlaid.
```

### Prompt:
```
Generate a photorealistic image for a marketing flyer or about section. Scene: A modern, sunlit office in a historic Portland building (exposed brick, rain visible on windows).

Mood: Collaborative, empowering, forward-looking, professional but approachable.
